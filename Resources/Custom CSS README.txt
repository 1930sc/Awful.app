Customizing the Posts View in Awful
===================================

The posts view in Awful is styled using Cascading Style Sheets. You can tell
Awful to use your own stylesheet by placing .css files here. If you need any
help, come visit the thread:

If you place a file called "posts-view.css" in this folder, it gets used for
every thread in every forum you visit. The one built in to Awful is included in
this folder as "example-posts-view.css". Feel free to use it as a starting
point for your own stylesheet.

But that's not all! You can tell Awful to use your stylesheet only in certain
forums. For example, notice that the URL for YOSPOS is:
http://forums.somethingawful.com/forumdisplay.php?forumid=219
If you place a file called "posts-view-219.css" here, it will be used for all
threads in YOSPOS, but not for any other threads.

The <body> tag will have the "dark" class if the dark theme is enabled. It will
have the "iphone" class on an iPhone, and the "ipad" class on an iPad. Have a
look at the example to see how we use these classes.

Once again, if you need any help, please come say hi.
