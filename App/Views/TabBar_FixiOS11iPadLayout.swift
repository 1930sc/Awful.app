/**
 On iOS 11, `UITabBar` lays out its items with title and icon stacked horizontally whenever we're in a horizontally regular size class, and it does not do well if we constrict its width. Everything falls apart when the tab bar is in the primary view controller of a split view controller. So we subclass `UITabBar` here and override its trait collection.

 Hilariously, the most reasonable way to convince a `UITabBarController` to use a custom `UITabBar` subclass is in a storyboard. So we do that too.

 - Seealso: https://github.com/Awful/Awful.app/issues/357 where we were trying to puzzle this out.
 - Seealso: https://stackoverflow.com/a/45945937/1063051 which has this subclassing solution.
 - Seealso: https://github.com/bnickel/HidingTabBar which mentions that storyboard is the only reasonable way to crowbar a `UITabBar` subclass into a `UITabBarController`.
