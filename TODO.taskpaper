	- Weird rendering error in posts web view, e.g. only a half-height square in the middle of the screen is rendered, with a black border around it. @ipad
		"This happened :wtf: http://i.imgur.com/TsidRn2.png"
		"Every now and then I get a bug where parts of the page are just pure black for a screen length or more. There are generally a few such spaces per page, at irregular intervals. The points where they start and stop have no relation to the posts, or the lines of text. This is on an iPhone 5, with dark mode enabled. After a few minutes of this, the app crashes back to the main screen, and when I go back in, it's on whatever page I started the last session on (although otherwise all my page views and bookmarks update appropriately). There doesn't seem to be any way to force the crashes, I just need to wait around a minute after finding a blank patch. Anyway, just now it happened again, with a new twist: the back button, and then the five buttons at the bottom of the screen all disappeared. They were still functional, just not visible. Anyway this bug seriously sucks, every few days I'll load up the app and know, just KNOW, that it's going to crash soon, and in the meantime I just need to wait around and read the visible half of the thread."
	- State restoration falls apart when the app crashes.
		"I've noticed that when the app crashes it doesn't have the latest last-read value, I usually have to jump 2-3 pages ahead"
		Using standard UIKit state restoration. Something custom/else might fare better.
	- Embedded tweets with video have difficulty playing. @twitter
		"Seeing a lot of tweets with video on ipad not playing. The twitter play icon vanishes and is replaced with the stock ios one but a spinny loading indicator starts and never goes away http://i.imgur.com/4mDJvfz.png"
	- Back navbar button is poorly sized in landscape. (iPhone?)
		"When viewed in landscape, the 'go back' arrow in the top left sits too high and is also at 100% size while the bottom graphics shift to 50%."
	- Reply screen disappears when orientation changes.
		"While composing a reply in portrait, switch to landscape. The reply sheet disappears."
		Works on iPad. Test iPhone.
	- Crash attempt to view an archived thread without archives upgrade.
		"Trying to access an archived thread without archives consistently crashed Awful for me."
	- Deleting favourite smilies is not working in the keyboard.
	- Crash shaking to undo deleting a bookmark.
		"Fumbled fingered away another bookmark. Shake to undo crashed my app"
	- Video embed weirdness when changing orientation.
		"If I launch a video in portrait and then rotate to landscape it stops the video. I'm on a 6+." @iphoneplus
		"Not sure if this is Awful's problem but it's odd behavior: if you tap on a YouTube link, open it in the app, full screen it, then directly come back to awful via the app switcher awful changes over to landscape display, and changes back to portrait if you leave the app and come back. Latest awful latest iOS, iPhone 6." @awful3.8 @ios9.1
	- Crash attempting to act on a thread in a list after the list refreshes and the thread disappears.
		"There's a crash if you long-press on a thread while the list is refreshing, then act on it when it would've been removed from the list"
		"View a forum, before the forum automatically refreshes, press and hold on a thread so the context menu shows up. If the thread you pressed on refreshes off the page of the forum you are viewing and interact with it, such as "jump to last page" the app seems to consistently crash."
	- Crash when emptyquoting.
		"I just emptyquoted a post and it kicked me to the home screen Here is the post I made: https://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3787824&perpage=40&pagenumber=34#post463816557 Making this post did not kick me to the home screen."
	- Thread list auto-update happens irregularly.
		"Also, the thread list auto update only seems to work when first viewing a forum after launching the app, but not from there on in if you return to that same forum."
	- Bookmarks list not refreshing/updating properly.
		"My bookmarks list is only showing the first ~10 threads on my iPad. Scrolling down leads to endless blankness. Not happening on my phone."
		"Bookmarks list won't refresh for me since yesterday.  I get the 'busy' spiral animation above and below the list, and the one below just continues indefinitely."
	- Toggling a spoiler can change the height of a post.

	- "Open YouTube in YouTube.app" setting should affect youtu.be links too. @youtube
	- Can't pick tag or subject using VoiceOver in new thread screen.
	- YOSPOS ignores some Themes.plist values.
		"curious how themes.plist works with the string values. Like why does YOSPOS ignore some of the values, and is that something I can work on."
		Also ignores navigationBarTextColor and toolbarTextColor.
	- Alerts about error code 999.
		"You prob already got this one, but if I scroll to the end of a thread with no new replies I get error code 999 instead of just refreshing to the bottom."
		"I got a new error number while trying to pull up a thread while it was refreshing but ios 8 made me unable to share pics. It was NSURLErrorDomain -999"
		NSURLErrorCancelled = -999
	- Failure scraping a particular post.
		"The app refuses to show the first unread post in one particular thread http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3522689 I have bookmarked. If there is one new post and I tap on the thread, it loads the thread but doesn't show the post, and instead it says 'End of thread'. If there are several new posts in that thread, it will show the posts after the first unread posts, but still not that one. If I go to previous posts it does show up. It only happens in that thread, and only since the latest update, I think. I'm on an iPhone 5s, 7.0.4 and am using version 2.0.1 of the app." @ios7.0.4 @awful2.0.1
	- Vimeo embeds are just a blank space.
		"Hey also are Vimeo video tags supposed to do anything but appear as a big blank space in a post?"
		Example http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?goto=post&postid=458029326#post458029326
	- Posts page links can be hard to tap.
		"When I encounter difficulties with clicking on a link and it opening, selecting some text on the screen seems to allow me to open the link with the next click.   Can anyone confirm or deny this next time they run into that issue?"
	- Back button stops working in posts screen.
		"As for the thing where the back button seems to stop working, that happens when you swipe the Safari View Controller away instead of tapping the Done button. And it actually breaks a whole bunch of other buttons too."
		"I'm on Awful 3.9, iOS 9.2, iPhone 6S+ and it happens to me every time I swipe out of Safari View Controller. It only happens when swiping away though. Hitting the Done button doesn't make the bug happen." @awful3.9 @ios9.2 @iphoneplus
		"I was coming to report the same issue and this helped me test exactly where it happens. It's consistent and breaks every time exactly under these situations. Specifically it breaks being able to swipe or hit the back button out of the thread, as well as the tap to bring up the quote/report etc. buttons and the profile info buttons. I'm on 3.9, iOS 9.2, iPhone 6S." @awful3.9 @ios9.2
		"Clicking back on some bookmarked threads or swiping back to the bookmark list doesn't work sometimes."
		"Yeah, reading a thread with multiple pages will cause the back button to grey out and require a force close and relaunch."
		"occasionally I have to force-close the app when the back button decides to stop working" (iPhone 5S)
	- YOSPOS thread list not updating with theme change.
		"I found how to change the theme in YOSPOS threads, but the main thread listing for YOSPOS was still green with that terrible font on the iPad."
	- Can't scroll enough in compose screen with iPad split keyboard.
		"Not sure if you guys are aware, but if you're typing a ridiculously long post on the iPad and attempt to use the split-keyboard, you can't scroll down far enough to see the bottom line of what you're typing. This happens on both landscape and portrait view. Merging the keyboard back together brings the text box view back to normal and you can see everything again."
	- Crash quoting a user when a custom keyboard is selected.
		"I get crashes every time I quote a user when using a custom keyboard. When the modal view animates up, the keyboard and quoted post appear and then the app crashes. In general this seems to be most present when quoting, making new replies doesn't seem to trigger it initially. However, once I've done it once, I can't make any kind of post quotes or not because it will crash every time. I do use a custom keyboard(either Fleksy or Swiftkey), which triggers this crash. Using a regular keyboard doesn't seem to cause the app to crash." @ios9.0 @awful3.6
		"I'm also getting that crash problem when replying to threads or quoting posts while using SwiftKey, like the problem mentioned in the to-do list. The editor pops up for just a moment and then the app vanishes. When I restart it, it's usually at some place on the forums I was reading earlier, well before I tried to write a post, but it doesn't seem to have anything to do with where I last posted. Closing the app from the task switcher does not fix the problem. It's on an iPhone 5s, iOS 9." @ios9
		"I'm having the same issue with Swype on a 6 w/9.0.2. I know you've already got it listed, but I figured I would try to give you a little more detail in case it helps. After the crash it will reset my position in the forums and my last read part counter on the thread I was trying to reply to to the top of its last page. It seems to happen more frequently if I click reply, or quote, right after I finish scrolling. If I wait a second or two and let the view "rest" it sometimes won't crash. That's how I got to type this reply actually." @ios9.0.2
		Crash is WebThread triggering a layout pass, which throws an exception because it's not on the main thread.
	- Text selection issues in posts screen.
		"Tap + hold on a word to select it. Then tap + hold on a different word that is at least a few lines away from your initial selection. This produces four distinct issues
			1: the magnifying loupe that pops up is the wide rectangular version that is supposed to occur only when dragging selection boundaries, rather than the large circular initial-selection magnifying loupe;
			2: the loupe is vertically located to magnify the same line as the previous selection, although its horizontal position is correct (moving your finger even slightly causes the loupe to correct itself);
			3: the word you're pressing on doesn't show the tentative selection, nor does the old selection disappear, until you release; and
			4: if you release your press as soon as the new selection is triggered, the selection and/or the loupe appears by quickly shifting to the proper location from the previous selection's location, rather than simply appearing the proper location without any movement.
			Issue #1 looks like it might be the intended new iOS 9 behavior for non-input text fields since Safari (the full-on app) also shows it. Similarly for issue #2 and #4 although they definitely seem like bugs. Issue #3 appears to be unique to Awful.app.
			Issue #2 will actually move the current view to ensure that the old selection is visible, if you had scrolled the old one offscreen before starting a new selection, probably disrupting or ruining that selection attempt." @iphoneplus @ios9.0.2 @awful3.7
	- Posts screen text menu stops appearing after opening Awful Browser.
		"Open an external site in the app (e.g. http://www.example.com), open the Share sheet, then close the Share sheet and the Safari view. Now the next time you select text, the "Copy / Define / Select All / Share..." popover menu will not appear, even if you drag the selection bounds around a bit more or scroll the view. The menu will tease an appearance when you dismiss the selection but (as far as I can tell) is not interactive for the brief flash while it's visible. The popover menu will appear properly, and can be interacted with, for any further selection you make. This problem also occurs (more reliably?) if you reload a thread or open a thread with new posts."
	- Freeze previewing a post in GBS.
		"The newest version freezes when I try to preview a post on GBS. I'm on an iPhone 6+ with the latest iOS update" (probably iOS 9.0.2 or 9.1)
	- Animated GIF overlay doesn't appear when "show images" setting is set to "off".
		"If you have embedded image autoloading set "off", the new "freeze animated gifs till you click them" overlay never appears even after tapping the image URL to load it, and animated gifs stay frozen forever."
	- Nothing loads in Awful Browser.
		"I'm having an issue with the app on my 6S+. I can't seem to open any links in the built in browser. When I first click on the link it shows a blank page and when I hit the refresh the load bar stalls at about 10%. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling."
		"The built-in browser only seems to work like 10% of the time for me now. Most of the time it just shows a blank page with a blank URL. Opening the link in Safari works fine."
	- Long-pressing a YouTube embed on an unread post and pressing "Open in Safari" makes app non-interactive. @youtube
		"If you encounter an unread post containing an embedded YouTube video (use "Mark Read" on a previous post if necessary), long-press the video's title and hit "Open in Safari". When you return to Awful app, all interactive elements within the thread become non-interactive -- I'm guessing they're occluded by the invisible remnants of the long-press menu. You can scroll around and select text, but you can't open anyone's profile, quote/"mark as read" any posts, follow any links or load any embedded images, etc.
			While in this glitched state, the app's UI surrounding the thread view works except for a few things
				the auto-hiding "Load Previous Posts" button only pretends to work by graying out on tap but doesn't actually do anything.
				you can show and hide the mini-options popup as normal, but none of its contents do anything (app colors work only for the UI but the thread is unaffected).
				oh also try opening any of the bottom-of-screen popups, then use the App Switcher to open another app that has an keyboard active (e.g. Safari or Notes both work). The popup will be halfway up the screen when you return to Awful using the App Switcher, and then will slide back down into place as (presumably) either the app or the system notices that the keyboard is no longer actually present.
			The inactive thread elements issue persists if you return to your Bookmarks view (probably Forums view too but I haven't checked) and then swipe back into the glitches thread. It is fixed if you tap any thread, including tapping the same previously-glitched thread."

	- Can't 3D Touch just anywhere on a bookmark thread cell to preview the thread. @3dtouch
		"in the bookmarks tab you have to do the 3d touch on the actual icon to the left of each bookmark, not the text."
	- 3D Touch through a bookmark in the bookmarks list fails. @3dtouch
		"Using 3D Touch to preview a thread from my bookmarks works, but if I press harder to open the thread it fails and says it couldn't load it."
	- Crash tapping "Post" resulting in a double-post.
		"Just encountered a bug I haven't seen before on the latest release. When replying to a thread, when I tap "post" the app sometimes crashes and when I reopen the app, I discover that it posted duplicate. Latest update [3.8], iPhone 5s running iOS 9.1" @awful3.8 @ios9.1
	- Misplaced cursor typing into a compose text box.

	- Bookmarks list "load more" spinner appears unhelpfully.
		"my bookmarks now have a spinning loading icon at the bottom of the list that won't go away."
		"I have this too, when refreshing bookmarks there are two loading icons, and sometimes the bottom one never goes away."
	- Crashing tapping a thread where some individual posts are disappeared.
		"The app crashes when clicking threads that have had individual posts beecocked (moved to a dump thread). Example: Amourphos Blob Containment Thread http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3747724 However, it could be that it only crashes when you'd clicked the thread in the app before the posts were deleted, or if enough posts were deleted to reduce the page count."
	- Can't dismiss post action sheet in landscape on iPhone 6+. @iphoneplus
		"in landscape mode, click on a post's bottom-right ellipsis. I don't see any good way to dismiss the sheet that pops up. Rotating back to portrait partially worked the first time (thread still had a slight overlay from the info sheet in portrait, but tapping somewhere removed the overlay), but not the second time (could not dismiss the sheet in landscape, could not remove the overlay in portrait; couldn't interact with the thread regardless). Didn't try the other buttons from landscape. (Also the landscape sheet is weirdly enormous.)" @iphoneplus @ios8.4 @awful3.4
	- Seemingly unnecessary line break in username "girth brooks part 2".
		"Also, there is a user named "girth brooks part 2" whose name renders oddly - the 2 is on a new line even though there is plenty of room. I can't check if it's some Unicode wankery in the name but I'm guessing the forum can't handle that anyway."
	- Back button disappears on empty detail screen on iPad. @ipad
		"As I'm dicking around with the iPad version in the simulator, it looks like there's a bug where if the size changes and no thread is open, the back arrow might not appear so you're stuck looking at a blank screen unless you rotate to landscape."
	- Automatic refresh shows top half of the spinner.
		"automatic refreshes don't show the whole spinner, just the tip [sic] half. Manual refreshes are fine." @awful3.7-beta0
	- Compose input accessory view stays visible after backing out.
		"Posted in a thread, backed out and hit power button & the custom keyboard bar stuck on the bottom of the screen when I turned my phone back on. http://i.imgur.com/zzqQfd1.png It followed back into this thread and when I tapped a button it crashed."

	- iPad interface goes portrait-width in landscape.
		"Sometimes this http://i.imgur.com/YMDAjkt.png happens on the iPad. I don't really know what triggers it, but it hasn't happened to me on the iPhone. Restarting the app fixes it."
		"It happens while using the app normally. Rotating the device might be involved, but I'm not 100% sure."
	- Forums list not auto-refreshing.
		"Why don't forums update automatically when opened? I've had to manually drag to update since the last version."
	- Threads list not auto-refreshing.
		"Forums also no longer automatically refresh when I enter them. I have to manually pull down to refresh each time I go into a forum."
	- Posts page cutting off bottom bit of content.
		"In the latest beta I'm seeing the bottom of pages cut off and only able to be seen if you scroll and hold. As soon as you release it goes back down. It's like the bounds of the webview and the toolbar aren't lined up. Not only on posts either, it's everywhere in the app."
	- Difficulty loading page two of a list of threads.
		"When I go to load the second page of threads after reloading the list it doesn't always load up the second page. Sometimes I can scroll up ever so slightly and it'll load."
	- Can't tap done or otherwise back out of finished YouTube videos when viewing in Awful Browser. @youtube
		"when I use the app browser to view YouTube videos, decently often I can't get back out of the video at the end. I have to force close the app and find where I was before. I can use the "open in (browser)" for the links which redirects to the YouTube app (the only thing that hasn't had the same issue since iOS 8's release) but it opens a tab in the browser as well. It's mildly annoying, which is why I didn't bother mentioning it for a while but I was just curious if anything was still planned for it."
		"If I click through to a YouTube video and play it, it goes full-screen but the Done button doesn't close it. Have to force-quit."
		"Not sure if this was covered but intermittently I've opened some YouTube links in the awful browser and found the Done button top left doesn't dismiss the player interface."
		"Video links are a coin flip as to whether they will let me escape or not. I will click on a video link, then on the new page, click on the video itself. It starts playing (swaps to full screen automatically) but about 50% of the time I can get out of the video. Hitting done or the resize button does nothing. At first I thought it had to do with locking the phone mid-video, but have since had it happen after just watching 10-15 seconds of a video. Whether the video is playing, paused or just ended also seems to have no particular relevance. If I close out the app, it will reload itself on the page outside the video. Not really able to narrow down what causes it unfortunately."
	- App fails to log out when session is apparently destroyed.
		"okay it's doing it [nothing loads when I try and refresh my bookmarks] again. basically, sometimes when i'm browsing i'll get an "error, not logged in" and then things will stop loading. if i exit the app i'll need to log back in, but once i log in i'll just get loading errors and will need to log back in again if i exit the app. it has fixed itself randomly and then gotten bad again at least twice"
	- Crash previewing a new thread in PHIZ.
		"Whenever I try to post in my own thread in PHIZ the app instantly hard crashes when I get to the post preview window."
	- Avatars and smilies swapping.
		"Lots of avatars and smilies have swapped places for some reason in the app. :grin: displays as the :D smilie for me, and :D shows up as Black Baby Goku's avatar."
	- Nothing finished/errors refreshing.
		"On an iPhone 5C, the vast majority of the time when I try to refresh anything - bookmarks, a thread - it never completes. It spins and spins forever. Occasionally it'll eventually throw a generic error about not being able to complete it. I have to force close the app to get it to work. This happens across wifi and 3G/4G networks, it's definitely not a connection speed issue." @awful3.3
	- Stuck in a reply screen with no thread and the cancel button crashes or doesn't work.
		"http://i.imgur.com/dorSrRU.png I had to reinstall because when I opened the app I was trapped in a reply box for a non exsistant thread. Cancelling would crash the app to springboard. Hard resetting my phone or closed the app from the spring board never helped."
		"I just had a terrible bug where I was stuck in between the post and preview screen and pressing cancel did nothing. Tried force closing the app and restarting my phone multiples times with no luck, it kept bringing me back to that very same post screen. Only thing that worked was deleting the app and reinstalling it to reset the whole affair."
			"Couldn't get back to the side menu or any other screen outside of those two editor screens. Restarting the app and even restarting the phone didn't help, somehow the app preserved that bugged state and only reinstalling it reset it."
			"Canceling an edit basically just wouldn't happen, neither Delete Edit or Save Draft did anything, though closing the app through multitasking got it just fine. E: Update! This happens consistently with editing posts. Like this one for example! You have to preview and save changes, canceling or saving the draft does nothing at all."
			
			"I do have messages, but they are viewed and kind of old."
	- Can interact with the posts view behind a share popup.
		"If you long-press on a link to show the sharing menu and keep touching the screen after it comes up, you can then drag that finger to scroll the backgrounded+tinted thread around." @ios8.2 @awful3.2
	- Profile modal disappears when changing orientation.
		"If you open someone's profile dialog* in landscape orientation, it disappears if you switch to portrait. You can then scroll around and even open someone else's profile sheet in portrait orientation; if you switch back to landscape, the portrait profile sheet will be closed but the initial landscape profile dialog* returns !! The portrait profile sheet stays closed when you return to portrait though. *I'm calling the landscape profile popup a "dialog" to distinguish it from the portrait profile sheet thing, since they behave qualitatively differently here. Not sure of the actual behind-the-scenes terminology in Cocoa Touch or in the Awful codebase." @ios8.2 @awful3.2
	- Weird empty view visible abottom the bookmarks list.
		"My bookmarks screen has this empty space at the bottom now. http://i.imgur.com/WFwpWVn.png"

	- Crash adding image to compose text box.
		"If I [img] -> camera -> take photo -> use photo I get a crash every time."
		"I get the same with importing from library."
	- Profile loading screen is very bright in dark theme.
		"In dark mode the loading screens (external URL or profile) are very bright. Could a change be made to have Awful's renderer be theme-aware?"
		Might already be fixed.
	- Using (smilie?) keyboard when composing a post causes a grey region on the screen.
		"Any time I use the smilie keyboard when composing a reply it then grays out the bottom half of the screen after posting which requires killing the app to clear. http://i.imgur.com/SU270j2.png"
		"Setup: while reading a thread in Portrait orientation, either start scrolling and hit New Reply, or hit one of the Quote Post buttons and then start scrolling the thread so it's still scrolling when the reply sheet comes up. Now hit Cancel. Expected behavior: the reply gets canceled/hidden and everything goes back to reading the thread like normal, same as if you weren't scrolling when the reply sheet came up. Actual behavior: The gray box behind the keyboard sticks around, obscuring the bottom ~40% of the view, including the bottom bar that contains the widgets for display settings, page controls, and thread info. If you hit New Reply (no scrolling this time) again it'll bring you back to your reply and the keyboard will reappear, but the gray box keeps staying behind if you Cancel again. The box also remains if you go back to the Bookmarks screen. Workarounds: flipping to landscape and back mostly gets rid of the issue. Likewise mostly fixed if the view is scrolling again when you reopen the reply sheet. I say "mostly" because the gray box doesn't get glued back to the keyboard, but it does slide off the bottom of the screen about half a second after the keyboard does."
	- Tapping where the Done/Share buttons are in the image preview when they're hidden doesn't cause them to appear.
		"If you have the image viewer sheet open and you tap to hide the "Done" and Share buttons, tapping in the top left and bottom right corners (where the buttons where) does not re-show those buttons."
	- Maybe turn off swipe-down-to-dismiss image preview while zoomed in.
		"I love image view but swipe down to dismiss needs to be disabled while zoomed in."
	- Crash pasting a [url] in a compose screen.
		"Sometimes when a URL is in the clipboard, tapping the [url] option from the context menu to try to paste it (the top-level option, which would normally list "[url] | Paste" when selected) crashes Awful. It seems intermittent, but a cursory follow up suggests that copying a link in Safari by doing a long-press on the link and copying from the modal popup is the most reliable way to reproduce the behavior. The fact that this copy mechanism is putting a special blob in the clipboard that Awful can't handle seems to be supported by the fact that pasting and re-copying the text from a third app seems to avoid the issue."
	- Don't crash loading a rap sheet.
		"I had someone else's rap sheet crash on me tonight but yours [jivjov's] doesn't. Pokeyman's does, though. Couldn't load the "bad" ones at all, let alone scroll to the bottom...immediate crash." (pokeyman's rap sheet is empty, dunno if relevant)
		"Scrolling through the Rap Sheet for poster Literally the Worst triggers a repeatable crash for me. Edit: seems to be all rap sheets, hitting the bottom of my own crashed the app as well Edit 2: Pokeyman, attempting to load your rap sheet at all causes a crash. All of this on a fully updated app on a fully updated iPhone 6+"
	- Compose menu gets busted after posting a photo.
		"After posting a photo, when I go to post another photo, tapping [img] shows an incorrect non functioning list (not Camera, Library, etc.) until after a force quit. I'm on iPhone 6, iOS 8.1.2, and Awful 3.2. Edit: I don't even have to post the photo. If I insert the photo, delete everything in the post, then cancel the post, when I go to post again (can be different thread), the non functioning list occurs. I have to delete the whole post to trigger this; even with 1 letter left saved in the cancelled post, things are ok. http://i.imgur.com/GcouYpU.png Edit2: now it seems when I tap hold to post a subsequent photo, the top level list appears correctly but just goes away when I tap [img]. Then when I tap hold again, the top level list is messed up and the buttons on the second image just make the list go away: http://i.imgur.com/IunQbeN.png http://i.imgur.com/X3hkbmH.png It appears to be flipping between states because when I tap hold a third time (odd number of tap holds) the process in edit2 repeats. Edit3: I can't replicate edit2. The replicable problem is that the edit1 non functioning submenu shows up when I tap [img] in the top level menu."
	- Messed kerning in compose text box.
		"Third, the text in the reply box is all kinds of fucked up in regard to spacing. Maybe I'm just seeing shit, but the space between individual letters is seriously whacked out. They seem too close to each other."
	- Can't delete favourite smilies from the keyboard.
		* "I still cannot seem to trigger the delete action on any smiley added to the favorites. Tapping on the little red icon in reorder mode appears to do nothing."
	- Bright flash behind toolbar while a thread loads.
		"Latest beta: Something bright loads behind the toolbar when a thread loads, and then once it is fully loaded it disappears. My money is on the Sasquatch from Ski Free."
	- New post button moves around a bit in the navbar.
		"Can the new post button be a bit more static? It moves a couple of pixels to the left on my 5s when I enter a thread."
			"I don't think that's exactly what's happening. On my 6, when you click on a new thread, it shifts right during the thread entry transition, then shifts back left when the thread is loading."
			"Actually, it does both. It depends whether you're entering from your bookmarks or a forum." http://i.imgur.com/x1LcgLE.gif http://i.imgur.com/Ok8d98x.gif
	- VoiceOver considers each line a separate element when touched, but the whole field as one when swiped to.
		"Only things I've noticed as of now is that VO won't read the entire contents of a field if the field is given focused by a touch rather than swiping into it from another element. Each line of text is its own element when touched but the whole field is unified when swiped to. Not really a dealbreaker."
	- Smilies are unlabeled in VoiceOver.
		"And the emoticons are unlabeled. Dunno if there's a way to let VO see the text used to create the emoticon. That would be the most expedient way to fix it. Manually labeling them seems a leetle time consuming to me."
	- Can't scroll while tapping and holding text selection in compose screen.
		"also still this: in post/reply/edit screen. tap and hold text -> select -> drag selection box upward -> screen will not scroll, just jitters spastically -> now my penis is soft"
	- Sometimes thread lists refuse to load next page.
		"I can't figure out a rhyme or reason for it but when I get to the bottom of the thread list in certain forums like GBS or Ask/Tell it refuses to load the next page of thread titles. No spinning thing or acknowledgement there might be more either. Still using the beta on my 6+ btw." @iphoneplus @awful3.2
		"The other thing is that I've been having a bug where, when I come back to the app after a long while, scrolling to the bottom of the first page of threads doesn't trigger the automatic loading of the second page of threads. I have to go to the top, reload the listing and then go back to the bottom to have it load more."
	- Bizarre thread list behaviour after refreshing threads.
		"http://i.imgur.com/TdWirMc.png I opened the app and refreshed it and it did this."
	- Crash in posts page scrolling down.
		"Scrolling down this page seems to regularly cause a crash or brief hang then crash: http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3177805&perpage=40&pagenumber=280 iPhone 6, iOS 8.1.2, latest Awful" @ios8.1.2
	- Tapping back + reply at same time in posts page breaks things.
		"If you're in a thread and hit the back button + reply at the same time it breaks. Sometimes it brings up the post screen which cancel does nothing to, sometimes cancel brings you back to a greyed out Bookmarks."
	- Maintain scroll position when returning to a thread list from a thread.
		"Every time I back out of a thread the forum page is scrolled down by a lot from when I actually clicked on the thread and it's really annoying"
	- Page numbering gets screwy when failing to load a posts page.
		"Also when the internet connection crashes, and it doesn't load the new posts in a thread, and then you make a post with the regained connection, the page numbering goes wild, like "137/136""
		"Trying to go pull for next page on a poor connection (causing the alert “specified hostname could not be found”) will remain on the current page as expected but still increment the page counter at the bottom. This can be done multiple times. Not sure how it behaves after this when connection is restored, I force killed the app expecting that it’d get into a wacky core data state." @ipad @ios11b1
	- Viewing certain users' rap sheets fails and can get stuck in infinite loop.
		"I noticed a user that had a name referencing another user named Aatrek, and when I saw a post by this Aatrek guy I decided to check out his rap sheet to see what got him permabanned. I tried to view the post via rapsheet but nothing would happen when I selected it. Then I tried looking at some of his older (archived) probations and got a 'post not found' dialog box and hit close, then tried tapping the topmost post again (which I think should still be viewable because it's in the gas chamber) and got stuck in a loop of 'post not found' dialog boxes that would pop up again as soon as they were dismissed. Pressing the back arrow got me out of it, though. Edit: oh... Ah... Hmm. Well, I never go to TVIV so I guess I wouldn't know. Edit 2: went to safari and saw that the permabanned post isn't linked or doesn't exist. So now I know why I couldn't view it."
	- Crash deleting multiple PMs in quick succession.
		"Just wanted to mention the app quits out if you delete a couple private messages one after the other. Edit: apparently I can't compose and send a new pm from scratch but replying to PMs works. The send button gets greyed out, cancel button doesn't work so I need to force quit it."
		"I had this same error this afternoon. The PM did successfully send though."
	- Lengthy Leper's Colony entries jump around when tapping and holding.
		"When you tap or tap and hold on an LC entry with a long probate/ban reason, as it highlights the box changes size to cut some lines off. It fixes itself if you tap-hold-scroll and seemingly if you try to screenshot. iOS 6.1.4 iPhone 5. Test case: the ban at http://forums.somethingawful.com/showthread.php?threadid=3571226&perpage=40&pagenumber=1#post419710507"
		Still a thing?
	- Viewing own profile comes up blank.
		"anyone else have an issue on the app when trying to view your own profile? not that it matters, but my own profile loads up as a blank page. It's for the best, probably" @iphone6s
	- Odd queueing/caching behaviour with multiple pages in a forum.
		"after loading a few extra pages in a forum, sometimes Awful will attempt to load that many pages again on subsequent visits to the forum. Oftentimes the app will freeze while it tries loading everything, but still buffer any touch events you might be giving it so it loads everything simultaneously. Doing a pull to refresh will sometimes collapse it back down to one page temporarily, and logging out and back in resets the page counter. iphone se 3.17 but it happened to my old 5s as well" @awful3.17
	- Minor weirdness with username in the post preview screen.
		"Also I'm seeing some minor weirdness with the username in the post preview screen. So far I've seen my name showing up in blue like I'm the OP of a thread when I'm not, and I've seen my mod star not show up. I have not been able to reliably reproduce either of these."
	- Post preview ignoring dark mode?
		"Post preview on ipad seems to be ignoring the dark mode setting and always displaying nondark mode"
	- "Some YouTube videos disappear while playing just showing the thread but the audio keeps going even when you go to next page. iOS 10.2 iPhone 6."
	- "Opening and closing sub forum listings seems to completely break the forums list. About 80% of the time the list doesn't visually expand/collapse, but tapping on the screen will lead me to a seemingly random forum." @iphone7
		"attempting to refresh the forums list page causes everything off screen to vanish; scrolling down leads to a blank abyss."
	- "A tiny bug I found that's tricky to reproduce unfortunately, but if you open an unread thread, go back and try to tap and hold the same thread before/right as it adds the unread post number and makes its way up to the top of the forum thread list, the forum freezes. The top bar still works so you can go back to the forums list after which everything is fine. Like I said, a tiny bug."
	- Replies silently failing to post.
		"Twice today I have replied to a thread only to be dumped back at the top of the page like I'd edited a post and my post has disappeared into thin air"
			Wonder if there's some error state we failed to check, so we sail right through to "let me show you your new post" without actually throwing an error?
			"Yeah, I'm guessing this. Is there a timeout error when replying to a thread multiple times in a short period of time or when lots of people are replying to a thread and maybe the app can't figure out where the post should be?"
		"Pretty sure this [server-side post throttling] is correct and the only reason people are noticing it more and more recently is because of some weird fuckshit with the server clocks happening lately. It's supposed to be a 10 second limit in between posts but sometimes it'll arbitrarily reject a post when it's been more like 60 seconds since your last. I don't think that's a problem on the Awful app's end but it would be nice if it held onto your post and it didn't just disappear into the void"
	- "Image upload failed" error when posting without an image.
		"Occasionally I get this error when trying to make a post. I wasn't uploading an image. https://i.imgur.com/O0WjBrU.jpg"
	- PiP messes with touches somehow.
		"iPad 10.5" Pro, 10.3.4, Awful thread with Picture in Picture (running Plex if it matters.) Touch is 'janky'. Scrolling a thread up and down jitters a lot. Trying to select a thread from the list view is hit or miss, sometimes doesn't register touches sometmies the wrong thread is selected. Location of where the PIP is matters for how this is effected. I think something in the new size + PIP is causing weird misscalculations. I've noticed something similar in a Unity game where if PIP was on the right, then a touch on the right registered several inches lower than where it really touched (Maybe trying to subtract the PIP window size.) My 'workaround' is to basically constantly move the PIP window based on where I'm reading / scrolling / tapping but it's pretty egregious."
	"For the last couple months, can't pin down exactly when it started but it continues today after updating to the latest version, clicking youtube links open in safari. Even if I long press and use the "Open in YouTube" popup button. Not a huuuugggee issue but sometimes It leads to me having a ton of tabs open. "
	- Seeing HTML in the Leper's Colony.
		"I'm not sure if this is app or SA related, but I'm seeing HTML in the lepers colony. That's been going on since the last Awful patch." (Awful 3.24 probs)
	- Truncated forum list after restoring from backup.
		"Think something might be wrong with fetching the forum list. Restored on a new device from backup today and this is the forum list now: http://i.imgur.com/D3tXEUE.png"
	- Missing avatars.
		"A couple of avatars are not showing up for me even after clearing cache."
		"The avatar for forums user PinkoBastard doesn't render at all. Latest iOS, iPhone 7+" (iOS 10.3.3 or so, Awful 3.24)
	- Empty tag list in filter screen.
		"I logged out today to try to fix this phantom sticky thread that still thought it was sticky even though it wasn't, and now no thread tags show up when I try to filter by thread tag. Awful 7.25, iPhone 9.3.5" (Awful 3.25 probs)
		"Can't seem to filter by tag... http://i.imgur.com/JB7BwJO.png"
