     1Password will show a "Show All Logins" button if no logins are found matching `urlString`.

     - Parameter urlString: A domain filter for the logins shown by 1Password. Only the domain is considered, and subdomains are included. Passing `https://example.com` will match logins for all of `example.com`, `spiffy.example.com`, and `excellent.example.com`.
     - Parameter sender: Where the share sheet popover should point. Note that `.none` is likely to crash on non-phone devices.
     - Parameter completion: A block to call after attempting to find login info. The block is called on the main queue.

     - Note: Must be called on the main queue.
