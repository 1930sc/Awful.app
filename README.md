An unofficial app
-----------------

This app is not endorsed by Something Awful.

Build
-----

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AwfulDevs/Awful.git`
2. Open Xcode project and build away: `cd Awful && open Awful.xcodeproj`

There are optional dependencies for building Awful. You only need them if you're working on the relevant part of the app. Once a dependency is installed, simply build the Xcode project and the relevant files will be regenerated.

* [LESS][] helps us write CSS. If you're modifying the themes for displaying posts (these are files like `posts-view*.less`), please [install LESS][LESS].
* [mogenerator][] makes Objective-C classes from our Core Data model. If you're modifying the Core Data model (aka `Model.xcdatamodeld`), please [install mogenerator][mogenerator].

If you want to use Crashlytics, create a file called `crashlytics-api-key` containing your API key.

[mogenerator]: http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator/
